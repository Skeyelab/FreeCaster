# FreeCaster - Current Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: After RAOP unification

## ✅ What Actually Works

### Device Discovery ✅ FULLY WORKING
- **macOS**: NSNetServiceBrowser finds devices via mDNS
- Discovers all `_raop._tcp` services on the network
- Resolves hostnames and ports
- Updates GUI in real-time
- **TESTED**: Found 8 AirPlay devices successfully

### Plugin Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- VST3 format compiles and loads
- Standalone app runs
- Audio passthrough works
- GUI displays and updates
- Thread-safe audio buffering

### Cross-Platform Build ✅ WORKING
- JUCE 8.0.4 integration
- CMake build system
- macOS (arm64) tested and working
- Windows/Linux ready (untested)

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented

### RAOP Client ⚠️ BASIC STRUCTURE ONLY
**Current State**:
```cpp
// RaopClient::connect() - Does basic RTSP handshake
- Connects TCP socket ✅
- Sends SETUP command ✅
- Sends RECORD command ✅
- BUT: No actual audio data transmission ❌
```

**What's Missing**:
- RTP packet construction
- Timing synchronization
- Audio data streaming
- Authentication handling
- Encryption (if required)

### Audio Streaming ❌ NOT WORKING
The `sendAudio()` method is a stub:
```cpp
bool RaopClient::sendAudio(const juce::MemoryBlock& audioData, 
                           int sampleRate, int channels)
{
    if (!connected)
        return false;
    
    // RTP packet construction would go here
    // This is simplified - real implementation needs RTP headers, timing, etc.
    
    return true;  // ← LIES! Returns true but does nothing
}
```

## ❌ Not Implemented

### 1. RTP Audio Streaming
Need to implement:
- RTP packet headers
- Sequence numbers
- Timestamps (NTP sync)
- UDP socket for audio data
- RTCP control channel

### 2. AirPlay Authentication
Many devices require:
- RSA key exchange
- Encryption setup
- Challenge-response auth

### 3. Audio Sync & Timing
- NTP time synchronization
- Buffer management
- Latency compensation

## 🧪 What Happens When You Test

### Current Behavior:
1. ✅ Launch FreeCaster → Works
2. ✅ See device list → 8 devices appear
3. ✅ Click "Connect" → Doesn't freeze
4. ✅ Status shows "Connected" → UI updates
5. ❌ Play audio → **Nothing streams to AirPlay device**

### Why Audio Doesn't Stream:
```
DAW Audio → FreeCaster → StreamBuffer → AirPlayManager → 
RaopClient → sendAudio() → [STOPS HERE] ❌
                              ↓
                         Should send RTP packets
                         Should reach AirPlay device
                         But doesn't! 🚫
```

## 🎯 What Needs To Be Done

### Priority 1: Make Audio Actually Stream
1. **Implement RTP packet format**
   ```cpp
   struct RtpHeader {
       uint8_t version:2;
       uint8_t padding:1;
       uint8_t extension:1;
       uint8_t csrc_count:4;
       // ... etc
   };
   ```

2. **Send UDP packets**
   - Create UDP socket
   - Send RTP packets with audio
   - Implement timing

3. **RTSP response parsing**
   - Parse server responses
   - Extract port numbers
   - Handle errors properly

### Priority 2: Handle Authentication
- Implement RSA encryption (if needed)
- Handle device pairing

### Priority 3: Improve Reliability
- Reconnection logic
- Error handling
- Network interruption recovery

## 📊 Honest Progress Assessment

| Component | Status | Reality Check |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Build System | ✅ 100% | Actually works |
| GUI | ✅ 100% | Displays correctly |
| Device Discovery | ✅ 95% | Finds devices (needs Windows/Linux testing) |
| RAOP Connection | ⚠️ 30% | Connects but doesn't stream |
| Audio Streaming | ❌ 5% | Structure exists, no actual streaming |
| Authentication | ❌ 0% | Not implemented |
| **Overall** | **⚠️ 40%** | **Looks done but core feature missing** |

## 🔍 The Truth

FreeCaster is a **great foundation** but:
- ✅ Excellent infrastructure
- ✅ Proper architecture
- ✅ Cross-platform design
- ❌ Doesn't actually stream audio to AirPlay yet

It's like building a beautiful car with:
- ✅ Perfect body
- ✅ Working dashboard
- ✅ Seats and steering wheel
- ❌ But no engine installed

## 🚀 Next Steps to Make It Actually Work

1. **Study RAOP protocol** (shairport-sync source code)
2. **Implement RTP** packet construction
3. **Add UDP streaming** logic
4. **Test with real devices**
5. **Handle edge cases**

Estimated work: **20-40 hours** for a working implementation.

## 📝 Lessons Learned

- Started too optimistically marking todos as "complete"
- Structure ≠ Functionality
- Need to test at each stage
- RAOP protocol is complex (Apple doesn't document it)

## 💡 Current Value

Even though audio doesn't stream yet, FreeCaster provides:
- Complete JUCE VST3 plugin template
- Working device discovery
- Clean architecture for RAOP implementation
- Cross-platform build system
- Good starting point for anyone wanting to build AirPlay streaming

---

**Bottom Line**: FreeCaster compiles, runs, finds devices, but doesn't yet stream audio. The hard part (RAOP streaming) remains to be done.
